# COMP2110 Web Development Assignment

This project implements the Bob's Jobs web application for the COMP2110
Web Development assignment.

Full details of the assignment requirements are in [the doc folder](doc/assignment.md).

## Getting Started

Once you have cloned a copy of this repository locally you need to install the
dependancies using `npm`. This requires that you have `node` and `npm` installed.

The overall project consists of two sub-projects for the backend and the frontend.
Each is independant in terms of code and the backend project (Strapi) will have
its own `package.json` file and node modules installed. You will need to create
that project when the time comes.

In the main folder, you need to install the project dependencies (`http-server`
to run the frontend server
and `cypress` for testing):

```shell
npm install
```

To run the tests you can open up the Cypress GUI:

```shell
npm run cypress
```

The tests are split into 12 separate files so that we can run them automatically
as part of the Github Classroom grading. Initially the tests for levels 1 and 2
are provided. Otherse will be added later. You may not change anything about
the tests (we would be able to see from the git logs).

## For detail on each file for the front end, please open the README.md file in the frontend folder.
